With this Plugin you can track multiple blogs and authors who also use the Kalendi Plugin as well as announce events in a calendar format.

== Description ==

The Kalendi WordPress Plugin adds a high degree of flexibility to blogging. With this Plugin you can extend your blog to track multiple blogs and authors who also use the Kalendi Plugin.   You are  able to have cross-blog posts, manage events and much more.  If you enjoy reading blogs by other authors, why not tell your viewers about these blogs? With the Kalendi WordPress plugin this is a simple task. 

As an added benefit sometimes you want your blog viewers to be aware of your schedule. You're at this conference, you're reviewing this software, etc. With the Kalendi Plugin you can simply add events to your calendar and your viewers can automatically be aware of them.

The plugin widget displays a calendar and lists events or posts by date underneath the calendar.
