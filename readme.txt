\f1 The Kalendi WordPress Plugin adds a high degree of flexibility to blogging. With this Plugin you can extend your blog to track multiple blogs and authors who also use the Kalendi Plugin.\'a0\'a0\'a0You are\'a0\'a0able to have cross-blog posts, manage events and much more.\'a0\'a0If you enjoy reading blogs by other authors, why not tell your viewers about these blogs? With the Kalendi WordPress plugin this is a simple task. \
\
As an added benefit sometimes you want your blog viewers to be aware of your schedule. You're at this conference, you're reviewing this software, etc. With the Kalendi Plugin you can simply add events to your calendar and your viewers can automatically be aware of them.\
